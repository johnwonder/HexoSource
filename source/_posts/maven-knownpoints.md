### Maven中的BOM概念

BOM stands for Bill Of Materials. A BOM is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a project’s dependencies and provide a central place to define and update those versions.

BOM provides the flexibility to add a dependency to our module without worrying about the version that we should depend on.
